## About

LRC Editor is a small, minimal Android app that helps you to create and edit .lrc (lyric) files. It's got all the necessary features required to edit LRC files easily. Timestamps can be both fine and coarse tuned. You can edit lyrics, insert more lyrics, batch edit timestamps and much more. Also, you can open LRC files directly from your file manager<sup>1</sup>. The best part is that LRC Editor is completely free of ads!

You can then use the LRC files in Karaoke applications, Music players etc that support it. The stock music players of major phone manufacturers like Xiaomi, Huawei, OPPO, Samsung and more support LRC files. LRC files aren't supported on LG's stock media player, the Google Play Music app among others.

**Note**: To get the best precision from this app, use a high quality constant bitrate MP3 file or another music container that is designed for precise seeking and isn't compressed. Compressed music files usually don't have accurate seek information in them which might lead to desync issues.

<sup>1</sup> [Samsung's stock file manager has issues with this](https://github.com/Spikatrix/LRC-Editor/issues/16)

## Permissions

LRC Editor requires the storage permission so that it can read and save LRC files.

Note: Android 11 brings much more stricter storage access enforcements and LRC Editor might not be able to access storage even after granting the storage permission.

## Build from source

If you wish to build from source, clone the repo and run gradle's assembleDebug task:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Spikatrix/LRC-Editor
	$ cd LRC-Editor
	$ ./gradlew assembleDebug

(Use `gradlew.bat` if you're on Windows)

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and open the project in Android Studio and then build the app from there.
